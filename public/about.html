  <p>
    This is a demo application written using the MEAN stack specifically built to demonstrate:
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation of Bootstrap dropdown via Angular directives</li>
      <li>Angular based todo app</li>
      <li>Express, Mongo, and Node based api</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I prioritized speed of implementation, while exploring the MEAN stack.  It took 5 hours, over two sessions, to build and finish up.  About half the time was spent learning about the stack and the other half in coding.

  <p>
    Much of the code based on tutorial and example code from:
    <ul>
      <li>Scotch.io Tutorials</li>
      <li>Boostrap and Angular Bootstrap UI Documentation</li>
      <li>Stack Overflow solutions</li>
    </ul>
